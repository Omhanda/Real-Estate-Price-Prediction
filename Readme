Starting with converting the target variable "Price" into a specific value, further data cleaning is performed which includes removal of outliers in the dataset. Some feature Extraction process is also performed on the Bedroom column as the dataset is having properties with different BHK properties. After data Pre-Processing like converting some categorical variables into numerical format by using LabelEncoder, Linear Regression method is used to precheck of prediction values which results in more than 90% of accuracy.  
Further to increase the accuracy, Hyperparameter Tuning process has done by using Grid Search method by developing an automated function which takes 3 random regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Lasso Regression) by different parameters and gives the best model for price prediction. Finally an accuracy of 99.8% is achieved in price prediction by Decision Tree Regression.
As the model is ready to predict the price, a flask server named "server.py" is created which is useful to render the UI templates i.e "app.html" & "reslt.html" for predicting price with the help of pickle file of the model.
